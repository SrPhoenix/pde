Setting the after sale process and quality control at car dealerships to the purpose of increasing clients satisfaction

Workshop : it is important to set certain quality control and system checks. this is:
	- Making and preparing appointements
	- Vehicle reception
	- vehicle repair
	- vehicle delivery
Regular Maintenance includes intervals of time or the reach of a certain number of Kms
It is necessary to have a "check list" for checking the service: Pratical examples of car repair and suggestions of control

Making and preparing appointements:
	- Check filled capacity of the workshop
	- Calculate the time of the repair
	- Explaine the cost to the client and what the regular service includes
		- This implies a visual control of the vehicle present conditions (damages,...)
	- TAKE THE CLIENT'S STATEMENT IN A CORRECT AND PRECISE WAY

Workshop maintenance include:
	- the process of repair 
	- service reports about performed work
	- information about extension of work
	- the final test drive
	- respecting the promised time
	- car wash
	- parking at proper place

Which comes ﬁrst, organizational culture orperformance? A longitudinal study of causalpriority with automobile dealerships

Hypothesis 1: In sales and service departments, the department culture has causal priority over customer satisfaction.
Hypothesis 2: In sales departments, the department culture has causal priority over vehicle sales.
Hypothesis 3: In sales and service departments, the department culture and performance (i.e., vehicle sales andcustomer satisfaction) are reciprocally related over time, as evidenced by a positive performance-to-culture feed-back loop.
Hypothesis 4: In sales departments, customer satisfaction mediates the relationship between the departmentculture and vehicle sales.

- For service departments, the results supported thehypothesis that culture has causal priority over customer satisfaction (Hypothesis 1) but failed to support thehypothesis of reciprocal relationships over time (Hypothesis 3).
- Therefore, re-sults for sales departments supported the hypothesis that culture has causal priority over customer satisfaction(Hypothesis 1) but failed to support the hypothesis of reciprocal relationships over time (Hypothesis 3).
- Therefore, results support the hypothesis that culturehas causal priority over vehicle sales (Hypothesis 2).
- Therefore, results supported customer satisfactionas fully mediating the culture-to-vehicle sales relationship.
Our results suggest a causal chain, whereby the culture of sales departments affects customer satisfaction, which, inturn, inﬂuences the number of vehicles sold.
